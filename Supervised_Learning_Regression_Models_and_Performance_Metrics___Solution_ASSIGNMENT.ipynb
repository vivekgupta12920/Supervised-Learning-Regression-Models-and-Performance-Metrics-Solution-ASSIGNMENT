        "\n",
        "-> Simple linear regression is a statistical method to model the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y), finding the best-fitting straight line (\\(Y=a+bX\\)) to predict Y from X, showing how changes in X relate to changes in Y, and identifying the strength and direction of this linear connection. It's the simplest form of regression, used for understanding how one input feature impacts in output\n",

        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. Like MAE, it is expressed in the original units of the data, but because it squares the errors before averaging, it penalizes larger errors more heavily. It is widely used in 2025 as a standard measure of a model's prediction precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "R-squared (\\(R^{2}\\)): Also known as the coefficient of determination, this metric measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.
